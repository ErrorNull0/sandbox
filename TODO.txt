COMPLETED:
- fixed crash on non-players punching villagers
- show an alert and prevent trading if villager is still trading with another player
- added coins for villagers to accept payment (and to give payment when buying item from player)
- initial trading farmspec with each item containing random stock 1 - 10, and each item just costsing 1 coin
- currently all villager types have test/dummy items to trade (which will change later)
- added more chat dialgue to 'home' villagers for now

TODO:
- add quest/sell items to all townhalls.. or well/fountains if no townhall
- add 'mystery street merchant'
- complete detailing cost and available stock for goods that villagers can sell to players
- make item stock based on the item type: expensive items have less stock, but bigger villages have more stock.
- complete item cost system. each item will have random cost but will be high cost in general for bigger villages.
- make certain villagers have nothing to trade at all.
- add another chat category for villagers called 'info' that pulls from a common pool of useful game facts.
-- for now, only librarians, smith, tower gaurds, and house residents give random game facts.
- slightly reduce the chance for smalltalk chat for each villager

- test when alert message when player tries to trade with villager who is currently trading with another player

- ensure homes with multiple inhabitants follow these patterns:
-- 1 inhab: a) adult male b) adult female c) old male d) old female
-- 2 inhab: a) adult male and female b) old male and female c) more to come
-- 3 inhab: a) adult male and female and young b) old male and female and young
-- 4 inhab: a) adult male and female and two young b) old male and female and adult female and young
-- 5 inhab: a) adult male and female and three young b) old male and female and adult male and female and young

- make custom dialogue also based on village type. Ex: huts in medieval are larger and have beds and huts in cornernote do not.

- make the village region type (hot, cold, normal, native, desert) not based purely on the village type, but instead
-- based on the surrounding blocks from the village spawn point. 

- allow villagers to walk through doors
- while villager is walking and attempting to chat, show chat bubble 'pardon me', 'excuse me', 'sorry', 'coming through', 'walking here', etc.
- due to many more spawned villagers matching each bed, make most of these villagers walk the roads instead of randomly wandering around the plot

- add new variable 'vDoorFound' and 'vDoorPosition' that stores the position of a found door as verifyPath() executes
- after each walk action, check if vDoorFound is true contains a position and currPos + 2 nodes forward doesn't hit maxDistance, then set action to USEDOOR
- USEDOOR: villager opens door, walks forward two nodes, and closes door, then sets action to STAND.

- have villagers appear on bed laying down at night
- make villagers that have no beds lay on the ground at night with a sleeping mat (maybe next to a tree or building)

- have guards wield a shield and/or weapon
- make tower villagers appear atop tower

- have farmers/field workers plant seedlings if they encounter bare soil
- make field villagers stay near their fields and not wander off
- villager wields the tool depending on what item digging - shovel for snow, hoe for crops and soil, etc

- make church villagers look for and stay inside the church

- add support for weather mod
- have villagers say something different depending on weather

- when adding more hair textures start using v1.8 type
- add probability for adult and old males to have beards
- add probability for gloves in cold regions
- add more jacket styles
- add more female short sleeved, long sleeved and sleeveless shirt styles
- add different dress type of males (currently using slightly modified texture of female full dress)
- add more full dress styles for females

- allow villagers to kill mobs
- allow villagers to get 'knocked out' (but not die) from attackes
- knocked out villagers will automatically recover and stand back up after some time
- cannot trade with a knocked out villager
- knocked out villager can only respond like 'uuuhg', 'ouch', 'help', etc when knocked out
- player can right-click on villager with a healing item to help recovery

- complete a simple trading system
- upon trading, formspec also pulls from villager's inventory of dug/harvested crops


ISSUES/BUGS:
- gambit and sandcity village types have no beds
- cornernote village type does not have beds in their huts
- on very rare occasions villagers seen to walk diagonally
