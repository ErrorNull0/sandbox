update: woke up this pm, stomach growling a bit and still the constant dull hunger sensation in the gut. but sore throat is gone and head feels better. still lethargic and since yesterday my speach is a big tired and forced. at work now, counting down each hour until midnight - about 4 more hrs!! watching coworker munching on his sliced cucumbers and keto friendly chicken curry dip sauce.. smells nice.........
