This mod spawns villagers in Sokomine's mg_villages mod. I want to provide a light-weight and simple mod where villagers have enough basic interactivity to make the villages more fun to visit and explore. The villagers will walk around, dig some things, provide random facts or smalltalk by chatting, and buy sell items by trading. They will not befriend you, become your travel buddy, or similate a daily routine or social community. 

I also focus on making the villager's appearance (skin, hair, clothing, etc) and chat dialogue random but also based on the region, climate, and type of village and building.

VISAUL FEATURES:
-chat popup bubbles and not player console
-skin, hair, clothing types randomly chosen
-random chat dialogue but also based on job
-random names but also based on region & age
-villagers stay near their assigned plots
-remembers prior position & actions on re-spawn
-continues prior action after chatting/trading
-villagers cannot 'hear you' if chatting to fast
-manually spawn villagers via chat command

TECHNICAL FEATURES:
-villagers spawn during mapgen - no ABM's
-infrequent action calculations - every 4-6 sec
-minimal walking & standing animation glitches
-checks if multiplayers chat/trade same villager
